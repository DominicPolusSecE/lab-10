# Bootstrap Practice Lab

This project is a responsive webpage built with Bootstrap, designed to showcase various Bootstrap components and utilities. The page includes a navbar, a hero banner, sections for services and portfolio, a contact form, and a footer. 

### Features
- **Responsive Navbar**: Collapses into a mobile-friendly menu on smaller screens.
- **Hero Banner**: Displays a welcoming message with a background image.
- **Services Section**: Organized in a grid layout to highlight different services.
- **Portfolio Section**: Uses Bootstrap cards for a neat and organized gallery.
- **Contact Form**: Includes fields for name, email, and message.
- **Footer**: Contains copyright information.

### Customization
Iâ€™ve customized the Bootstrap colors to give the page a unique look using custom CSS variables.

Have Fun!
